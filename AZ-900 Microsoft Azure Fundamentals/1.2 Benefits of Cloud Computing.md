# Benefits of Cloud Computing #

## Cost effective ##
* Provides pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model.
    * No upfront infrastructure costs.
    * No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure/hardware that you may not use to its fullest.
    * The ability to pay for additional resources only when they are needed.
    * The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
## Scalable ##
* Increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time.
* Cloud computing supports both
    * **Horizontal scaling**
      * Scaling "out"
      * Adding more servers that function together as one unit
    * **Vertical scaling**
      * Scaling "up"
      * Adding resources to increase the power of an existing server
          * e.g.Add more CPUs, or add more memory
