# Cloud Basics

### What is Cloud
----

* Delivery of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  * in other words: a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's data center.
* **Pay-as-you-go**: You're billed only for what you use
  * Instead of mainiting CPU's and storage in your data center, yor rent them for the time that you need them.
     * The cloud provider takes care if maininting the underlying infrastructure for you. 
* Example-
  1. **virtual machine** (VM)
  * A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop you’re using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. You can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want to run in the cloud.
  * The difference is that you don’t have to buy any of the hardware or install the OS. The cloud provider runs your virtual machine on a physical server in one of their datacenters.
  * With the cloud, you can have a VM ready to go in minutes at less cost than a physical computer.
  2. **Containers**
  * Containers are similar to VMs except they don’t require a guest operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is packaged into a “container” and then a standard runtime environment is used to execute the app.
  3. **Serverless computing**
  * Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can build a serverless process that automatically sends an email confirmation after a customer makes an online purchase.
