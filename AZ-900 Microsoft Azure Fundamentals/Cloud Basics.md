### What is Cloud
----

* Delivery of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  * in other words: a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's data center.
* **Pay-as-you-go**: You're billed only for what you use
  * Instead of mainiting CPU's and storage in your data center, yor rent them for the time that you need them.
     * The cloud provider takes care if maininting the underlying infrastructure for you.
