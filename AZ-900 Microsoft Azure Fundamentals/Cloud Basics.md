### What is Cloud
----

* Delivery of computing services over the Internet using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  * in other words: a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's data center.
* **Pay-as-you-go**: You're billed only for what you use
  * Instead of mainiting CPU's and storage in your data center, yor rent them for the time that you need them.
     * The cloud provider takes care if maininting the underlying infrastructure for you. 
* Example-
  * A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop you’re using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. You can then install whatever software you need to do the tasks you want to run in the cloud.
  * The difference is that you don’t have to buy any of the hardware or install the OS. The cloud provider runs your virtual machine on a physical server in one of their datacenters.
  * With the cloud, you can have a VM ready to go in minutes at less cost than a physical computer.
